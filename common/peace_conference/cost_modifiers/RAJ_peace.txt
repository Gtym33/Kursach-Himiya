# Scripted cost modifiers for peace actions

## How to access data from the peace action
#- `ROOT` - Negotiator country (who is doing the negotiation)
#- `FROM` - Taker country (who will be the owner after the conference)
#- `FROM.FROM` - Giver country (who was the owner before the conference)
#- `FROM.FROM.FROM` - State (iff peace action refers to a state)

#You might have to use e.g. `ROOT.FROM` to access the variable from inside another scope

## Possible peace action types
#- `take_states`
#- `puppet`
#- `force_government`
#- `liberate`
